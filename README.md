Repository for Converters from Eventdisplay format (ROOT-based) into FITS / HDF5 / etc.
This allows to use data products in proprietary format (e.g., from CTA or VERITAS) to be used with public science tools like gammapy.

- convert event lists from ROOT to FITS format: [DL2](DL2/README.md)
- convert IRFs from ROOT to GDAF/FITS format: [DL3-IRFs](DL3-IRFs/README.md)

Docker containers are available for both converters.
